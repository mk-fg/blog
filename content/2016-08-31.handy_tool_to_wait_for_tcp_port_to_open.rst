Handy tool to wait for remote TCP port to open

Lack of some basic tool to "wait for connection" in linux toolkit always annoyed
me to no end.

.. code-block:: console

	root@alarm~:~# reboot
	Shared connection to 10.0.1.75 closed.

	% ssh root@10.0.1.75

	...time passes, ssh doesn't do anything...

	ssh: connect to host 10.0.1.75 port 22: No route to host

	% ssh root@10.0.1.75
	ssh: connect to host 10.0.1.75 port 22: Connection refused
	% ssh root@10.0.1.75
	ssh: connect to host 10.0.1.75 port 22: Connection refused
	% ssh root@10.0.1.75
	ssh: connect to host 10.0.1.75 port 22: Connection refused

	...[mashing Up/Enter] start it up already!...

	% ssh root@10.0.1.75
	ssh: connect to host 10.0.1.75 port 22: Connection refused
	% ssh root@10.0.1.75

	root@alarm~:~#

	...finally!

| Working a lot with ARM boards, can have this thing repeating few dozen times a day.
| Same happens on every power-up, after fiddling with sd cards, etc.

And usually know for a fact that I'll want to reconnect to the thing in question
asap and continue what I was doing there, but trying luck a few times with
unresponsive or insta-failing ssh is rather counter-productive and just annoying.

Instead:

.. code-block:: console

  % tping 10.0.1.75 && ssh root@10.0.1.75
  root@alarm~:~#

That's it, no ssh timing-out or not retrying fast enough, no "Connection
refused" nonsense.

tping_ (`code link`_) is a trivial ad-hoc script that opens new TCP connection
to specified host/port every second (default for -r/--retry-delay) and polls
connections for success/error/timeout (configurable) in-between, exiting as soon
as first connection succeeds, which in example above means that sshd is now
ready for sure.

Doesn't need extra privileges like icmp pingers do, simple no-deps python3 script.

Used fping_ as ``fping -qr20 10.0.1.75 && ssh root@10.0.1.75`` before finally
taking time to write that thing, but it does what it says on the tin - icmp
ping, and usually results in "Connection refused" error from ssh, as there's gap
between network and sshd starting.

One of these "why the hell it's not in coreutils or util-linux" tools for me now.
