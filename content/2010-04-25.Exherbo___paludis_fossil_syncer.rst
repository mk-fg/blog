| So far I like `exherbo <http://www.exherbo.org/>`_ way of package management and
  base system layout.
| I haven't migrated my desktop environment to it yet, but I expect it shouldn't
  be a problem, since I don't mind porting all the stuff I need either from
  gentoo or writing exheres for all I need from scratch.

| First challenge I've faced though was due to my late addiction to `fossil scm
  <http://www.fossil-scm.org/>`_, which doesn't seem to neither be in any of
  exherbo repos listed in unavailable meta-repository, nor have a syncer for
  `paludis <http://paludis.pioto.org/>`_, so I wrote my own dofossil syncer and
  created the repo.
| Syncer should support both fossil+http:// and fossil+file:// protocols and
  tries to rebuild repository data from artifacts' storage, should it encounter
  any errors in process.

Repository, syncer and some instructions are `here
<http://fraggod.net/svc/fossil/fg_exheres>`_.

Thought I'd give google some keywords, should someone be looking for the same
thing, although I'd probably try to push it into paludis and/or "unavailable"
repo, when (and if) I'll get a bit more solid grasp on exherbo concepts.
