A friend gave me this thing to play with (and eventually adapt to his purposes).

What's interesting here is that TI seem to give these things out for free.

Seriously, a box with a debug/programmer board and two microcontroller chips
(`which are <http://www.ti.com/product/msp430g2553>`_ basically your
programmable computer with RAM, non-volatile flash memory, lots of interfaces,
temp sensor, watchdog, etc that can be powered from 2 AA cells), to any part of
the world with FedEx for a beer's worth - $5.

Guess it's time to put a computer into every doorknob indeed.
