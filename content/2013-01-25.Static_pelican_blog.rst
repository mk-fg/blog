Static pelican blog

Ditched bloog_ engine here in favor of static pelican_ yesterday, and while I
was able to remember about keeping legacy links working, pretty sure I forgot
about guids on the feed, so apologies to anyone who might care.
Guess it's pointless to fix these now.

All the entries can be found `on github`_ now in rst-format, though older ones
might be a bit harder to read in the source, as they were mostly auto-converted
by pandoc and I only checked if they're still rendered correctly to html.

As appengine also made me migrate from master-slave db replication to the shiny
high-replication blobstore, I wonder if hosting static html here now counts as
abuse...
