| Dragonfall is probably the best CRPG (and game, given that it's my fav genre)
  I've played in a few years.
| Right mix of setting, world, characters, tone, choices and mechanics, and it
  only gets more amazing towards the end.

| I think `all the praise it gets`_ is well deserved - for me it's up there with
  early Bioware games (BGs, PST) and Fallouts.
| Didn't quite expect it too after okay'ish Dead Man's Switch first SRR
  experience, and hopefully there's more to come from HBS, would even justify
  another kickstarter imo.
