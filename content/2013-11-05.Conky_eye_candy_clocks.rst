Conky eye candy clocks and meters

So my laptop broke anyway, but on the bright side - I've got fairly large
(certainly by my display standards) desktop fullhd screen now.

While restoring OS there, decided to update ~/.conkyrc (see conky_), as it was
kinda small for this larger screen, so why not put some eye-candy there, while
at it?

		alt="conky screenshot">
	</a>

Leftmost radial meters show (inner-to-outer) clock with hands and rings right
next to them, blue-ish cpu arcs (right-bottom, outer one is load summary, inner
ones are per-core), used (non-cache) memory/swap (left), network traffic
(top-right, green/red arcs for up/down) and \/ and \/home df arcs (outer top).

On the right it's good ol' binary clock.

| All drawings are lua script, all text and graphs below is conky's magic.
| Rings are adapted from `"Clock Rings" script here`_, just added background
  planes and binary clock, because why not...

Whole script to draw the things can be found in `de-setup repo on gh`_ along
with full conkyrc I currently use.
