Phasing out fossil completely

| Having used git excessively for the last few days decided to ditch `fossil scm
  <http://www.fossil-scm.org/>`_ at last.
| All the stuff will be `in git <http://fraggod.net/code/git>`_ and mirorred on
  the `github <https://github.com/mk-fg/>`_ (maybe later `on bittbucket
  <https://bitbucket.org/mk_fg>`_ as well).

| Will probably re-import meta stuff (issues, wikis) from there into the main
  tree, but still can't find nice-enough tool for that.
| Closest thing seem to be `Artemis <http://www.mrzv.org/software/artemis/>`_,
  but it's for mercurial, so I'll probably need to port it to git first,
  shouldn't be too hard.

Also, I'm torn at this point between the thoughts along the lines "selection of
modern DVCS spoil us" against "damn, why they there is no clear popular +
works-for-everything thing", but it's probably normal, as I have (or had)
similar thoughts about lot of technologies.
