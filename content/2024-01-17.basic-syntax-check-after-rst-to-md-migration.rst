Basic markdown syntax/links checks after rst -> md migration

Some days ago, I've randomly noticed that github stopped rendering long
`rst (as in reStructuredText)`_ README files on its repository pages.
Happened in a couple repos, with no warning or anything, it just said "document
takes too long to preview" below the list of files, with a link to view raw .rst file.

Sadly that's not the only issue with rst rendering, as codeberg_ (and pretty
sure its Gitea_ / Forgejo_ base apps) had issues with some syntax there as well -
didn't make any repo links correctly, didn't render table of contents, missed
indented references for links, etc.

So thought to fix all that and convert these few long .rst READMEs to .md (markdown_),
which does indeed fix all issues above, as it's more popular format nowadays,
and apparently well-tested and working fine in at least those git-forges.

One nice thing about rst however, is that it has one specification and a
reference implementation of tools to parse/generate its syntax -
`python docutils`_ - which can be used to go over .rst file in a strict
manner and point out all syntax errors in it (``rst2html`` does it nicely).

Good example of such errors that always gets me, is using links in the text with
a reference-style URLs for those below, to not make plaintext really ugly,
unreadable and hard to edit due to giant mostly-useless URLs in middle of it.
And you have to remember to put all those references in, not leave any unused
ones ideally, and then keep them matched to tags in the text precisely, down to
every single letter, which of course doesn't really work with typing stuff out
by hand without some kind of machine-checks.

And then also, for git repo documentation specifically, all these links should
point to files in the repo properly, and those get renamed, moved and removed
often enough to be a constant problem as well.

Proper static-HTML doc-site generation tools like mkdocs_ (or its
popular mkdocs-material_ fork) do some checking for issues like that
(though confusingly not nearly enough), but those require a bit of setup,
with configuration and whole venv for them, which doesn't seem very practical
for a quick README.md syntax check.

MD linters apparently go the other way and check various garbage metrics like
whether plaintext conforms to some style, while also (confusingly!) often not
checking basic crap like whether it actually works as a markdown format.

Task itself seems ridiculously trivial - find all ``... [some link] ...`` and
``[some link]: ...`` bits in the file and report any mismatches between the two.

But looking at md linters a few times now, couldn't find any that do it nicely
that I can use, so ended up writing my own one - `markdown-checks tool`_ - to
detect all of the above problems with links in .md files, and some related quirks:

- link-refs - Non-inline links like "[mylink]" have exactly one "[mylink]: URL" line for each.
- link-refs-unneeded - Inline URLs like "[mylink](URL)" when "[mylink]: URL" is also in the md.
- link-anchor - Not all headers have "<a name=hdr-...>" line. See also -a/--add-anchors option.
- link-anchor-match - Mismatch between header-anchors and hashtag-links pointing to them.
- link-files - Relative links point to an existing file (relative to them).
- link-files-weird - Relative links that start with non-letter/digit/hashmark.
- link-files-git - If .md file is in a git repo, warn if linked files are not under git control.
- link-dups - Multiple same-title links with URLs.
- rx-in-code - Command-line-specified regexp (if any) detected inside code block(s).
- tabs - Make sure md file contains no tab characters.
- syntax - Any kind of incorrect syntax, e.g. blocks opened and not closed and such.

ReST has a nice ``.. contents::`` feature that `automatically renders Table of Contents`_
from all document headers, quite like mkdocs does for its sidebars, but afaik basic
markdown_ does not have such feature, and maintaining that thing with all-working
links manually, without any kind of validation, is pretty much impossible in particular,
and yet absolutely required for large enough documents.

So one interesting extra thing that I found needing to implement there was for script
to automatically (with ``-a/--add-anchors`` option) insert/update
``<a name=hdr-some-section-header></a>`` anchor-tags before every header,
because otherwise internal links within document are impossible to maintain either -
github makes hashtag-links from headers according to its own inscrutable logic,
gitlab/codeberg do their own thing, and there's no standard for any of that
(which is a historical problem with .md in general - poor ad-hoc standards on
various features, while .rst has internal links in its spec).

Making/maintaining a table-of-contents requires stable internal links,
validating that they're all still there, and ideally that all headers have such
internal link as well, i.e. new stuff isn't missing in the ToC section at the top.

Having such assigned/updated anchors in the .md file itself side-steps the issue
of potentially-crappy, uncontrollable, inconsistent or plain missing TOC-section
rendering (incl. control over what you want to maybe include/omit, or how to
name/split stuff there), and also creates stable anchor names for any external
links to such doc sections, as auto-generated ones tend to change, especially
for complicated headers, with e.g. links and symbols in them.

With checks for tricky syntax bits in place though, markdown READMEs seem to
be as tidy, strict and manageable as rst ones. Both formats have rough feature
parity for such simple purposes, but .md is definitely only one with good-enough
support on public code-forge sites, so a better option for public docs going forward.
