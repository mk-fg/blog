Recent fixes to great tools - 0bin and Convergence

I've tried both of these in the past, but didn't have attention budget to make
them really work for me - which finally found now, so wanted to also give
crawlers a few more keywords on these nice things.


0bin - leak-proof pastebin
``````````````````````````

As I pastebin a lot of stuff all the time - basically everything multiline -
because all my IM happens in ERC_ over IRC (with bitlbee_ linking xmpp and all
the proprietary crap like icq, skype and twitter), and IRC doesn't handle
multiline messages at all.

All sorts of important stuff ends up there - some internal credentials,
contacts, non-public code, bugs, private chat logs, etc - so I always winced a
bit when pasting something in fear that google might index/data-mine it and
preserve forever, so I figured it'll bite me eventually, somewhat like this:

.. html::

	<a href="{static}images/github_keys_fail.png">
	<img
		style="width: 400px;"
		src="{static}images/github_keys_fail.png"
		title="Google finds everything you forget"
		alt="massive security fail">
	</a>

Easy and acceptable solution is to use simple client-side crypto, with link
having decryption key after hashmark, which never gets sent to pastebin server
and doesn't provide crawlers with any useful data. ZeroBin_ does that.

But `original ZeroBin`_ is php, which I don't really want to touch, and have its
share of problems - from the lack of command-line client (for e.g. ``grep stuff
log | zerobinpaste``), to overly-long urls and flaky overloaded interface.

Luckily, there's more hackable python version of it - 0bin_, for which I hacked
together a simple `zerobinpaste tool`_, then simplified interface to bare
minimum and updated to use shorter urls (`#41`_, `#42`_) and put to my host -
result is `paste.fraggod.net`_ - my own nice robot-proof pastebin.

URLs there aren't any longer than with regular pastebins:

  http://paste.fraggod.net/paste/pLmEb0BI#Verfn+7o

Plus the links there expire reliably, and it's easy to force this expiration,
having control over app backend.

`Local fork`_ should have all the not-yet-merged stuff as well as the
non-upstreamable simplier white-bootstrap theme.


Convergence - better PKI for TLS keys
`````````````````````````````````````

Can't really recommend `this video`_ highly enough to anyone with even the
slightest bit of interest in security, web or SSL/TLS protocols.

| There are lots of issues beyond just key distribution and authentication, but
  I'd dare anyone to watch that rundown of just-as-of-2011 issues and remain
  convinced that the PKI there is fine or even good enough.
| Even fairly simple Convergence_ tool implementation is a vast improvement,
  giving a lot of control to make informed decisions about who to trust on the
  net.

I've been using the plugin in the past, but eventually it broke and I just
disabled it until the better times when it'll be fixed, but Moxie seem to have
moved on to other tasks and project never got the developers' attention it
deserved.

So finally got around to fixing `fairly massive list`_ of issues around it
myself.

Bugs around newer firefox plugin were the priority - one was compatibility thing
from `PR #170`_, another is endless hanging on all requests to notaries (`PR
#173`_), more minor issues with adding notaries, interfaces and just plain bugs
that were always there.

| Then there was one shortcoming of existing perspective-only verification
  mechanism that bugged me - it didn't utilize existing flawed CA lists at all,
  making decision of whether random site's cert is signed by at least some
  crappy CA or completely homegrown (and thus don't belong on
  e.g. "paypal.com").
| Not the deciding factor by any means, but allows to make much more informed
  decision than just perspectives for e.g. fishing site with typo in URL.

So was able to utilize (and extend a bit) the best part of Convergence - agility
of its trust decision-making - by hacking together a verifier (which can be
easily run on desktop localhost) that queries existing CA lists.

Enabling Convergence with that doesn't even force to give up the old model -
just adds perspective checks on top, giving a clear picture of which of the
checks have failed on any inconsistencies.

Other server-side fixes include nice argparse interface, configuration file
support, loading of verifiers from `setuptools/distribute entry points`_ (can be
installed separately with any python package), hackish TLS SNI support (Moxie
actually filed `twisted-5374`_ about more proper fix), sane logging, ...

Filed only a few PR for the show-stopper client bugs, but looks like upstream
repo is simply dead, pity ;(

| But all this stuff should be available in `my fork`_ in the meantime.
| Top-level README there should provide a more complete list of links and
  changes.

| Hopefully, upstream development will be picked-up at some point, or maybe
  shift to some next incarnation of the idea - CrossBear_ seem to potentially
  be one.
| Until then, at least was able to salvage this one, and hacking ctypes-heavy ff
  extension implementing SOCKS MitM proxy was quite rewarding experience all by
  itself... certainly broadens horizons on just how damn accessible and simple
  it is to implement such seemingly-complex protocol wrappers.

Plan to also add a few other internet-observatory (like OONI, CrossBear crawls,
EFF Observatory, etc) plugins there in the near future, plus some other things
listed in the README here_.
