D3 chart for common temperature/rh time-series data

More D3 tomfoolery!

It's been a while since I touched the thing, but recently been asked to make a
simple replacement for processing common-case time-series from temperature +
relative-humidity (calling these "t" and "rh" here) sensors (DHT22, sht1x, or what
have you), that's been painstakingly done in MS Excel (from tsv data) until now.

So here's the plot:

.. html::

  <a href="|filename|images/d3_t_rh_chart.jpg">
  <img
    style="width: 520px;"
    src="|filename|images/d3_t_rh_chart.jpg"
    title="d3 t/rh chart"
    alt="d3 t/rh chart image">
  </a>

| Interactive version can be run directly from `mk-fg/fgtk`_: `d3-temp-rh-sensor-tsv-series-chart.html`_
| Bunch of real-world data samples for the script: `d3-temp-rh-sensor-tsv-series-chart.zip`_

Misc feats of the thing, in no particular order:

- Single-html `d3.v4.js`_ + ES6_ webapp (assembed by `html-embed script`_) that
  can be opened from localhost or any static httpd on the net.

- Drag-and-drop or multi-file browse/pick box, for uploading any number of tsv
  files (in whatever order, possibly with gaps in data) instantly to JS on the page.

- Line chart with two Y axes (one for t, one for rh).

- Smaller "overview" chart below that, where one can "brush" needed timespan
  (i.e. subset of uploaded data) for all the other charts and readouts.

- Mouseover "vertical line" display snapping to specific datapoints.

- List of basic stats for picked range - min/max, timespan, value count.

- Histograms for value distribution, to easily see typical values for picked
  timespan, one for t and rh.

Kinda love this sort of interactive vis stuff, and it only takes a bunch of
hours to put it all together with d3, as opposed to something like rrdtool,
its dead images and quirky mini-language.

Also, surprisingly common use-case for this particular chart, as having such
sensors connected to some RPi is pretty much first thing people usually want to
do (or maybe close second after LEDs and switches).

Will probably look a bit further to make it into an offline-first `Service
Worker`_ app, just for the heck of it, see how well this stuff works these days.

No point to this post, other than forgetting to write stuff for months is **bad** ;)
