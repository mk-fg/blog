Adding color to tcpdump makes a ton of difference

Debugging the usual censorshit issues, finally got sick of looking at normal
tcpdump output, and decided to pipe it through a simple translator/colorizer script.

I think it's one of these cases where a picture is worth a thousand words:

.. html::

  <a href="{static}images/tcpdump-console-normal.png">
  <img
    style="width: 771px;"
    src="{static}images/tcpdump-console-normal.png"
    title="tcpdump console with IPv6 traffic"
    alt="tcpdump console with IPv6 traffic">
  </a>

This is very hard to read, especially when it's scrolling,
with long generated IPv6'es in there.

While this IMO is quite readable:

.. html::

  <a href="{static}images/tcpdump-console-color.png">
  <img
    style="width: 460px;"
    src="{static}images/tcpdump-console-color.png"
    title="tcpdump console with colorized traffic"
    alt="tcpdump console with colorized traffic">
  </a>

Immediately obvious who's talking to whom and when, where it's especially
trivial to focus on packets from specific hosts by their name shape/color.

Difference between the two is this trivial config file::

  2a01:4f8:c17:37c1: local.net: !gray
  2a01:4f8:c17:37c1:8341:8768:e26:83ff [Container] !bo-ye

  2a02:17d0:201:8b0 remote.net !gr
  2a02:17d0:201:8b01::1 [Remote-A] !br-gn

  2a02:17d0:201:8b00:2a10:6e67:1a0:60ae [Peer] !bold-cyan
  2a02:17d0:201:8b00:f60:f2c3:5c:7702 [Desktop] !blue
  2a02:17d0:201:8b00:de9a:11c8:e285:235e [Laptop] !wh

...which sets host/network/prefix labels to replace unreadable address parts
with (hosts in brackets as a convention) and colors/highlighting for those
(using either full or two-letter `DIN 47100`_-like names for brevity).

Plus the script to pipe that boring tcpdump output through - tcpdump-translate_.

Another useful feature of such script turns out to be filtering -
tcpdump command-line quickly gets unwieldy with "host ... && ..." specs,
while in the config above it's trivial to comment/uncomment lines and filter
by whatever network prefixes, instead of cramming it all into shell prompt.

tcpdump has some of this functionality via DNS reverse-lookups too,
but I really don't want it resolving any addrs that I don't care to track specifically,
which often makes output even more confusing, with long and misleading internal names
assigned by someone else for their own purposes popping up in wrong places, while still
remaining indistinct and lacking colors.
