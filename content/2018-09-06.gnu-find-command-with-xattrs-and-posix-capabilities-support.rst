GNU find command (findutils) with xattrs and posix capabilities support

It's been bugging me for a while that "find" does not have matches for extended
attributes and posix capabilities on filesystems.

Finally got around to looking for a solution, and there apparently is a recent
patch (Jul 2018), which addresses the issue nicely:

  https://www.mail-archive.com/bug-findutils@gnu.org/msg05483.html

It finally allows to easily track modern-suid binaries with capabilities that
allow root access (`almost all of them do in one way or another`_), as well as
occasional ACLs and such, e.g.::

  % find /usr/ -type f -xattr .
  /usr/bin/rcp
  /usr/bin/rsh
  /usr/bin/ping
  /usr/bin/mtr-packet
  /usr/bin/dumpcap
  /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon
  /usr/bin/rlogin
  /usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper

  % getcap /usr/bin/ping
  /usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep

(``find -type f -cap . -o -xattr . -o -perm /u=s,g=s`` to match either of
caps/xattrs/suid-bits, though ``-xattr .`` includes all -cap matches already)

These -cap/-xattr flags allow matching stuff by regexps too, so they work for
pretty much any kind of matching.

Same as with --json in iproute2 and other tools, a very welcome update, which
hopefully will make it into one of the upstream versions eventually.

(but probably not very soon, since last findutils-4.6.0 release is from 2015
about 3 years ago, and this patch isn't even merged to current git yet)

Easy to use now on Arch though, as there's `findutils-git in AUR`_, which only
needs a small patch (as of 2101eda) to add all this great stuff -
e.g. `findutils-git-2101eda-xattrs.patch`_ (includes xattrs.patch itself too).

It also applies with minor changes to non-git findutils version, but as these
are from back 2015 atm, it's a bit PITA to build them already due to various
auto-hell and gnulib changes.
