Since I've put some two-day effort into creation of `net-snmp
<http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/>`_ snmpd extension and had some free time to
report bug in `source of this inspiration
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-agentx/>`_, thought I might as well save
someone trouble of re-inventing the wheel and publish it somewhere, since snmpd
extension definitely looks like a black area from python perspective.

I've used `sf.net <http://sf.net/>`_ as a project admin before, publishing some
crappy php code for `hyscar project <http://sourceforge.net/projects/hyscar/>`_
with pretty much the same reasons in mind, and I didn't like the experience
much - cvs for code storage and weird interface are among the reasons I can
remember, but I'll gladly take all this criticism back - current interface has
by far exceed all my expectations (well, prehaps they were too low in the first
place?).

Putting up a full-fledged project page took me (a complete n00b at that) about
half an hour, everything being simple and obvious as it is, native-to-me `git
vcs <http://www.git-scm.com/>`_, and even `trac <http://trac.edgewall.com/>`_
among the (numerous) features. Damn pleasant xp, making you wanna upload
something else just for the sake of it ;)

| Oh, and the project is `snmpd-pyagentx
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/snmpd-pyagentx/>`_, `freshmeat page
  <http://freshmeat.net/projects/snmpd-pyagentx>`_ included.
| Just an alpha right now, but I'll polish and deploy it in production in a day
  or two, so no worries.
