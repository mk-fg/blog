fatrace - poor man's auditd

Was hacking on (or rather debugging) Convergence FF plugin and it became
painfully obvious that I really needed something simple to push js changes from
local git clone to ``~/.mozilla`` so that I can test them.

Usually I tend to employ simple ad-hoc ``for src in $(git st | awk ...); do cat
$src >...`` hack, and done same thing in this case as well, but was forgetting
to run it after small "debug printf" changes waaay too often.

At this point, I sometimes hack some ad-hoc emacs post-save hook to run the
thing, but this time decided to find some simplier and more generic "run that on
any changes to path" tool.

Until the last few years, the only way to do that was polling or inotify_, and
for some project dir it's actually quite fine, but luckily there's fanotify_ in
kernel now, and fatrace_ looks like the simliest cli tool based on it.

::

	# fatrace
	sadc(977): W /var/log/sa/sa24
	sadc(977): W /var/log/sa/sa24
	sadc(977): W /var/log/sa/sa24
	sadc(977): W /var/log/sa/sa24
	qmgr(1195): O /var/spool/postfix/deferred
	qmgr(1195): CO /var/spool/postfix/deferred/0
	qmgr(1195): CO /var/spool/postfix/deferred/3
	qmgr(1195): CO /var/spool/postfix/deferred/7
	...

| That thing can just watch everything that's being done to all (or any
  specific) local mount(s).
| Even better - reports the app that does the changes.

I never got over `auditd's`_ complexity for such simple use-cases, so was damn
glad that there is a real and simplier alternative now.

Unfortunately, with power of the thing comes the need for root, so one `simple
bash wrapper`_ later, my "sync changes" issue was finally resolved:

::

	(root) ~# fatrace_pipe ~user/hatch/project
	(user) project% xargs -in1 </tmp/fatrace.fifo make

Looks like a real problem-solver for a lot of real-world "what the hell happens
on the fs there!?" cases as well - can't recommend the thing highly-enough for
all that.
