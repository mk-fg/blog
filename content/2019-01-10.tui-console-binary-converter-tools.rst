Really simple curses-based tool which I've been kinda-missing for years:

.. html::

  <a href="{static}images/tui-binary-conv.jpg">
  <img
    style="width: 529px;"
    src="{static}images/tui-binary-conv.jpg"
    title="TUI dec/hex/binary converter tool"
    alt="TUI dec/hex/binary converter tool">
  </a>

There's probably something similar built into any decent reverse-engineering
suite or hex editor (though ghex doesn't have one!), but don't use either much,
don't want to start either to quickly check mental math, and bet GUI conventions
will work against how this should work ideally.

Converts between dec/hex/binary and helps to visualize all three at the same
time, as well as how flipping bits or digits affects them all.
