GHG - simplier GnuPG (gpg) replacement for file encryption

Have been using gpg_ for many years now, many times a day, as I keep lot of stuff
in .gpg files, but still can't seem to get used to its quirky interface and
practices.

Most notably, it's "trust" thing, keyrings and arcane key editing, expiration
dates, gpg-agent interaction and encrypted keys are all sources of dread and
stress for me.

Last drop, following the tradition of many disastorous interactions with the
tool, was me loosing my master signing key password, despite it being written
down on paper and working before. #fail ;(

Certainly my fault, but as I'll be replacing the damn key anyway, why not throw
out the rest of that incomprehensible tangle of pointless and counter-productive
practices and features I never use?

Took ~6 hours to write a replacement ghg_ tool - same thing as gpg, except with
simple and sane key management (which doesn't assume you entering anything,
ever!!!), none of that web-of-trust or signing crap, good (and non-swappable)
djb crypto, and only for file encryption.

Does everything I've used gpg for from the command-line, and has one flat file
for all the keys, so no more hassle with --edit-key nonsense.

Highly suggest to anyone who ever had trouble and frustration with gpg to check
`ghg project`_ out or write their own (trivial!) tool, and ditch the old thing -
life's too short to deal with that constant headache.
