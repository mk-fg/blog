Tend to mention random trivial tools I write here, but somehow forgot about this
one - `acme-cert-tool`_.

Implemented it a few months back when setting-up TLS on, and wasn't satisfied by
any existing things for ACME / `Let's Encrypt`_ cert management.

Wanted to find some simple python3 script that's a bit less hacky than
acme-tiny_, not a bloated framework with dozens of useless deps like certbot_
and has ECC certs covered, but came up empty.

acme-cert-tool has all that in a single script with just one dep on a standard
py crypto toolbox (cryptography.io), and does everything through a single
command, e.g. something like::

  % ./acme-cert-tool.py --debug -gk le-staging.acc.key cert-issue \
    -d /srv/www/.well-known/acme-challenge le-staging.cert.pem mydomain.com

...to get signed cert for mydomain.com, doing all the generation, registration
and authorization stuff as necessary, and caching that stuff in
"le-staging.acc.key" too, not doing any extra work there either.

Add ``&& systemctl reload nginx`` to that, put into crontab or .timer and done.

There are bunch of other commands mostly to play with accounts and such, plus
options for all kinds of cert and account settings, e.g. ``... -e
myemail@mydomain.com -c rsa-2048 -c ec-384`` to also have cert with rsa key
generated for random outdated clients and add email for notifications (if not
added already).
