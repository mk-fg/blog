This is a static blog built from rst_ files by Pelican_,
sources for everything here can be found in the `mk-fg/blog github repo`_.

Most code links from here go to `github.com/mk-fg`_, but if that doesn't
work for some reason (e.g. geopolitical bans), same repos can also be found
on `self-hosted cgit`_ and `codeberg.org/mk-fg`_.
