Thought it should be (hardly) worth a notice that Skype (well, Microsoft now)
offers a thing called SkypeKit_.

To get it, one have to jump through a dozen of hoops, including long
registration form, $5 "tax for your interest in out platform" and wait for
indefinite amount of time for invite to the privileged circle of skype hackers.

Here's part of the blurb one have to agree to:

	By registering with Skype Developer, you will have access to confidential
	information and documentation relating to the SkypeKit program that has not
	been publicly released ("Confidential Information") and you agree not to
	disclose, publish or disseminate the Confidential Information to any third
	party (including by posting on any developer forum); and to take reasonable
	measures to prevent the unauthorised use, disclosure, publication or
	dissemination of the Confidential Information.

| Just *WOW*!
| What a collossal douchebags people who came up with that must be.
| I can't even begin to imagine sheer scale of idiocy that's going on in the
  organization to come up with such things.

| And just as these things often go, here's the `Pirate Bay link`_.
| But I think I'd rather respect the right of whoever came up with that "hey,
  let's screw developers" policy, if only to avoid (admittedly remote) chance of
  creating something useful for a platform like that.
