Sources for my blog (blog.fraggod.net)
------------------------------

It was based on [bloog](https://github.com/DocSavage/bloog) engine in the past
(not present in this repo history), but it was a bad choice for a platform -
inconvenient to update, data not versioned properly and generally
hard-to-access, not to mention numerous minor issues.
Not a bad platform in general, just very poorly suited for my usage.

Currently it's a [pelican](http://getpelican.com)-based static blog, generated
from ReST sources in
[content](https://github.com/mk-fg/blog/tree/master/content) path.

Blog instance is deployed on Google AppEngine at
[blog.fraggod.net](http://blog.fraggod.net/) ([https appspot
