Sources for my blog (blog.fraggod.net)
--------------------------------------

It was based on bloog_ engine in the past (not present in this repo history),
but it was a bad choice for a platform - inconvenient to update, data not
versioned properly and generally hard-to-access, not to mention numerous minor
issues.

Not a bad platform in general, just very poorly suited for my "rare hacks and
edits by poweruser" use-case.

Currently it's a pelican-based_ static blog, generated from `ReST (.rst)`_
sources in `"content" dir`_.

Blog instance is deployed at: https://blog.fraggod.net/
